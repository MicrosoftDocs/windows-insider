## Start flighting

### Preparation

First, make sure you're ready to set up flighting:

- To install Windows Insider Preview Builds, you must be running a licensed version of Windows on your device. You can install Windows here if your device is currently running an older version or if you need to buy Windows. If you're having issues installing Windows, you can also download a Windows Insider Preview ISO to get started.

- The process of setting up flighting restarts your device during program setup and updating. Make sure you're ready for this, so you don't lose open documents or unsaved work. You might also want to take a picture of these directions or bookmark this page on your browser to get back to it easily.

- Make sure that we support your language.
