# Register for the Windows Insider Program for Business
The first step to participating in the Windows Insider Program for Business and installing Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds is to register as a Windows Insider. You have two registration options.

## Register using your work account (recommended)
Registering with your work account in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides valuable business benefits: 
* __Tag feedback__. Submitting feedback to us via the Feedback Hub using your Azure AD account helps us identify issues and suggestions from your specific organization.  
* __Track feedback__. You can track feedback from  other users in your organization who sign into the Feedback Hub with their Azure AD accounts. 
* __Manage installation__. Registering with your Azure AD account is the first step to being able to install and manage Insider Preview builds centrally across multiple PCs.
NOTE: Registering with an Azure AD account requires a device running Windows 10 Version 1703 or later.

> [!NOTE] 
> If your company is currently not using Azure AD but has a paid subscription to Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Enterprise Mobility Suite, or other Microsoft services, you have a free subscription to Microsoft Azure AD. This subscription can be used to create users for enrollment in the Windows Insider Program. 
> If you or other users don't have an Azure AD account, find out how to out how to get an [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant). 

## Register your personal Microsoft account 
If you do not have an Azure AD work account, you can use the same personal account that you use for other Microsoft services. If you want to register using a Microsoft account and don't have one yet, see [create account](https://signup.live.com/).

* You can switch the account that you used to register for the Windows Insider Program by going to __Settings > Updates & Security > Windows Insider Program__. Under __Windows Insider account__ select __Change__.
