# Give feedback on Windows Server Insider Preview Builds
Once you've had a chance to explore Windows Server Insider Preview Builds, give us your feedback in the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub) to help us continue to improve Windows Server. 

You can sign into the Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or your Azure Active Directory (AAD) work account. When you use your organization's account, you'll be able to give us feedback on behalf of your organization to help shape Windows to meet your business's specific needs.

## Give feedback with your Microsoft account

1. Open the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub) app on your device, make sure you're logged in with your registered Microsoft account.

2. Select the Feedback section from the side menu.

3. Select the **+ Add new feedback** button.

4. Under **Enter your feedback**, enter a title that says the build number you're providing feedback for, like this: [Server #####] Title of your feedback. Then explain your feedback in more detail.

5. Under **Choose a category**, choose if it's a problem or suggestion. Select **Windows Server** from the first dropdown and then the best subcategory for your feedback from the second dropdown. 

6. Continue to find similar feedback, and then add more details, like diagnostic information.

7. Submit your feedback.
