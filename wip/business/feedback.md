# Give feedback as a business

Once you've had a chance to explore Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds, you and users across your organization can give us your feedback in the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub) to help us fix issues, create new features and improvements, and continue to evolve Windows for everyone.

You can sign into the Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or your Microsoft Entra ID work account. When you use your organization's account, you'll be able to give us feedback on behalf of your organization to help shape Windows to meet your business's specific needs.

## Give feedback with your Microsoft account

1. Open the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub) app on your device, make sure you're logged in with your registered Microsoft account by checking the person icon on the bottom of the side menu.

2. Select the **Feedback** section from the side menu.

3. Select the **+ Add new feedback** button.

4. Under **Enter your feedback**, enter a title and explain your feedback in more detail.

5. Under **Choose a category**, choose if it's a problem or suggestion. Select the best category and subcategory for your feedback from the dropdowns. 

6. Continue to find similar feedback and then add more details, like screenshots, files, and diagnostic data.

7. Submit your feedback.
