You can sign into the Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or your Microsoft Entra ID work account. When you use your organization's account, you'll be able to give us feedback on behalf of your organization to help shape Windows to meet your business's specific needs.

## Give feedback with your Microsoft account

2. Select the **Feedback** section from the side menu.

3. Select the **+ Add new feedback** button.

4. Under **Enter your feedback**, enter a title that says the build number you're providing feedback for, like this: [Server #####] Title of your feedback. Then explain your feedback in more detail.
