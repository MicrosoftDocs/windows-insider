# Register for the Windows Insider Program for Business
To join the Windows Insider Program for Business, the first thing you have to do is register.

You can [register through the Windows Insider Program website](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/for-business-getting-started), or directly in the Settings App.

- For Windows 10: **[Settings> Update & Security > Windows Insider Program](https://aka.ms/WIPSettings)** and select **Get Started**.

- For Windows 11: **[Settings> Windows Update > Windows Insider Program](https://aka.ms/WIPSettings)** and select **Get Started**.

Register with either your Azure Active Directory (AAD) work account, which we recommend for the best experience, or your personal Microsoft account (MSA).

When you use your organization's account, you'll be able to give us feedback on behalf of your organization to help shape Windows to meet your business's specific needs. You must register with your AAD account to manage Windows 10/11 Insider Preview Builds centrally across your organization. If you don't have one, [find out how to get an AAD tenant](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).

You can also register with your personal Microsoft account (MSA), which is the same account you use for other Microsoft services, like email (@outlook.com), Microsoft Office, or OneDrive. (Don't have a Microsoft account? [Sign up now!](https://account.microsoft.com/account))
