# Providing feedback

One of the benefits of being a Windows Insider is knowing that your feedback can change and improve Windows for users around the world. The Feedback Hub app in Windows 10 lets you tell Microsoft about problems you run into while using Windows 10 and send suggestions to help us improve your Windows experience. Submitting feedback can be as easy as finding feedback similar to yours and upvoting it. The steps below can help you create and submit effective feedback. 

## Explore the Feedback Hub 

1. To open the Feedback Hub, go to [Start>Feedback Hub](insiderhub://home/).                                
2. Sign in (bottom left) with the account that you used to register for the Windows Insider Program. This gives you access to the full set of content and features available to Windows Insiders which are available under four tabs in the left margin:  
    __•	Feedback:__ tools to search, upvote and submit feedback.   
    __•	Announcements:__ news for Windows Insiders, including details about the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds.  
    __• Quests:__ step-by-step guidance for Windows features that we’re currently prioritizing and would like feedback on from Windows Insiders. For each Quest completed, you can earn points towards badges which appear in the Achievements section.   
    __•	Achievements:__ Windows Insider Achievement badges available to you as an Insider. 

__Note:__ 
When opening the Feedback Hub app, you may see a message to change your Feedback settings from “Basic” to “Full” or “Enhanced”. Select the link in the message to go to Settings. “Enhanced” lets you send verbatim feedback and “Full” lets you send diagnostic information so we can help diagnose problems on your device.
 
## Check for existing feedback  
1.	Enter your feedback topic in the __search bar__ on the main page of the Feedback Hub, or in the Feedback section. 
2.	Narrow your search results by select the link next to __Filters__ at the top of the Feedback section. You can filter problems and suggestions and find feedback that’s been addressed by Microsoft or needs more information. You can also filter search results by device type and functional categories. By clicking “My feedback” above the search box, you can group specific feedback you submitted or upvoted. 
3.	If you find the feedback you’re looking for, click the __upvote__ button next to the feedback item. You can also click __add comments__ to provide clarity to existing information or add other scenarios to review if needed.

__Note:__ Some feedback items are listed as “Collections” which gather together similar feedback. Collections are identified with an icon next to their title, so you can easily tell them apart from individual feedback. You can learn more about collections here.

## Add new feedback
If you don’t find a problem or suggestion in the Feedback Hub that is similar to yours, go ahead and create a new feedback item. The more precise the information you provide, the faster and more effectively we can address your feedback. This guidance can help: 
1.	Select __Add new feedback__ next to the search bar on the Home or Feedback pages of the Feedback Hub. 
2.	Under __Summarize your issue__, provide a clear title for your problem or suggestion. For example: “I can’t connect my printer” or “Groove crashes with error 80041007 when connected to Bluetooth.” 
3.	Under __Explain in more detail__, you can give us more specific information, like how you encountered the problem. For example: “When I try to print, I see a message that the printer is unavailable”.
4.	Under __Choose a category__, tell us whether you’re sending a __problem__ or __suggestion__. If something is broken or missing or you're getting errors, you should file a problem. If there's a new feature or change you'd like to see, file a suggestion.
5.	Confirm that the __category__ and __subcategory__ listed corresponds to your feedback. The Feedback Hub will automatically select a category based on the title you gave your feedback item. Use the dropdown menus to check or change the category. 

__Note:__ It's important to have the correct category to make sure your feedback is processed accurately and that certain logs and system settings are collected. For example, we may not be able to address a Bluetooth bug that gets filed under the Start menu, because we wouldn't receive the correct logs. 

6.	Under __Find Similar Feedback__, select from the list if an item matches yours and add more details specific to your issue. Select "New Feedback" if there isn’t a match. 
7.	Under __Add more details__, check “prioritize this as high severity” if the problem you are submitting has resulted in data loss, a security or privacy issue, or an inability to operate your PC. 
9.	Under __Attachments__, you can attach a screenshot or file related to your problem or suggestion. If applicable, you can also create a screen recording with more details.  
•	__For screenshots:__ Go to where the problem happened, press the Windows logo key + Print screen to take a picture of your screen. Then select “Attach a screenshot”, go to the Pictures/Screenshots folder, select the screenshot you want to send, and press Enter.  
•	__For “Recreate a problem”:__ Select the type of problem you are having, then click “Start recording” and run the steps that led to the problem. When you’ve completed the steps, select “Stop capture” to auto-attach to your submission. 
10.	When you’re satisfied with your feedback, select __Submit__.

__Note:__
If you need to report a problem that requires a more immediate or direct response, use the Get Help app or go to support.microsoft.com.

## Check the status of feedback
As Microsoft engineers process your feedback, you’ll see a banner appear on the feedback item confirming its status. There are five possible states:  
•	__We've Got It:__ Your feedback has been successfully submitted and is currently being reviewed by an area expert.   
•	__Looking into It:__ Your feedback has been reviewed, and we are currently investigating the best course of action to address the problem or suggestion.  
•	__Working on It:__ We’re working on making improvements to the experience based on the feedback you’ve shared.  
•	__Changes Made:__ We’ve made changes based on this feedback! The feedback item will let you know whether they’re available on your current build or app version, or whether you’ll need to update to see them. If you think there’s more we can look into, please leave a comment.    
•	__Needs more info:__ We need your help to understand this issue better. Please review our comments and add details below by recreating the problem or attaching files or screenshots.

When the state changes, you and other Windows Insiders who have upvoted the feedback will receive a notification from the Feedback Hub about the change.

__Note:__ You can track feedback submitted to the Feedback Hub by you and others in your organization (AAD account registration required). For details see: [Windows Insider Program for Business – feedback](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-insider/at-work-pro/wip-4-biz-feedback).

## Sharing your submission
After you submit feedback, you'll be able to share your submission with other Insiders. They might be experiencing the same issue as you or want the same feature or change that you’re suggesting. If you're asked to communicate directly with a Microsoft engineer later, you may also be asked to share a link to your feedback. To create a feedback link for sharing:
1.	Search for and open the feedback item you’d like to share. If you're looking for feedback you created, select the __My Feedback__ tab at the top.
2.	After selecting the right feedback item, choose the __Share__ button in the upper right corner. A small window will open with the newly created link.
