# Windows app updates 
You will find information on the latest major app updates for Windows 10 released to Windows Insiders here. Currently, app updates are sorted by date in which announcements of the app updates are made. 

_Note:_ Not all app updates will be listed here. Only app updates that include major changes e.g. new features, etc. will be noted here.

## Your Phone 
These updates are currently available using PCs running Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds (19H1). 

__7/10/2019__
## Phone screen now available on more Surface devices
As promised, we’re excited to expand the availability of the phone screen feature to more PCs. With the latest driver update in the Windows insider rings (Marvell 15.68.17013.110), the following Surface devices will preview the phone screen feature – Surface Laptop, Surface Laptop 2, Surface Pro 4, Surface Pro 5, Surface Pro 6, Surface Book, and Surface Book 2. If you have one of these devices, give it a try and let us know what you think!

__7/3/2019__

### Enabling touch functionality
You will now be able to interact with your phone screen using one-touch tap and long press. This handy feature will allow you to conveniently open apps, select items, click on links, and more, directly on your touch-enabled PC.

### Notifications integration with Phone screen
We’re pleased to launch Notifications integration with Phone screen for Insiders with the May 2019 update or newer. If Phone screen is set up, your notifications will open in Phone screen allowing you to interact with your keyboard and mouse. If Phone screen is not supported or set up, clicking on notifications will take you to your notifications feed instead.
Note that your text message notifications (SMS, MMS) will continue to be available within the messaging node.

### Phone screen – Accessibility features, keyboard language and layout, new phone models
We’re pleased to preview two new accessibility features – screen reading and focus tracking – as well as the ability to easily switch your Android phone’s keyboard language or layout while in phone screen.

__Screen reading.__
For users of TalkBack, you can now enable the Your Phone Companion accessibility service, found under your Android phone’s accessibility settings, for smoother cross-device reading. Once both TalkBack and the Your Phone Companion accessibility services are turned on, Narrator will play from your PC, describing what you select and activate on your phone screen as you interact using your PC’s keyboard or mouse.

![Your Phone](images/18908-1.png "your phone companion - accessibility service")

__Focus tracking.__
You will now be able to interact with your Android phone’s apps at your preferred magnification while in phone screen. Focus tracking will seamlessly follow your keyboard focus and mouse pointer input.
To enable the focus tracking accessibility feature, you must first turn on the Your Phone Companion accessibility service and TalkBack on your Android phone. Once these services are enabled, you can turn on Magnifier on your PC using the shortcut: Windows Key and the Plus sign (+) or open the app from your Windows menu.

![Your Phone](images/18908-2.png "focus tracking")

__Keyboard language and layout.__ You will notice a new icon on your phone screen toolbar. Selecting this icon will take you to the phone settings page, where you can change your keyboard language or layout. This setting is specific to physical keyboards, so it only applies when you’re typing into your phone from your PC and will not change your phone’s language or keyboard configuration. If you type in different languages or like to switch your keyboard layout, give it a try.

![Your Phone](images/18908-3.png "phone settings icon for keyboard")

__Phone screen now supports additional Samsung phone models.__
The supported phone model list keeps expanding, we have now enabled support for the Samsung Galaxy A8 and Galaxy A8+. We will continue to expand the list of devices over time.

* Windows 10 PC with Bluetooth radio that supports low-energy peripheral role
* Minimum Build 18338 and above
* Android phone must be on, within Bluetooth range of the PC, and connected to the same network as the PC

### New messaging features

__Unread message indicator (badge).__ 
* Nav pane – A visual indicator on the Messages node, indicating you have unread messages
* PC Taskbar – A visual indicator on the Your Phone app icon on your PC taskbar, indicating you have unread messages

This much-requested feature is now available. You can sync your photos, messages, and notifications over mobile data without having to connect your Android phone to the Wi-Fi network.
Enable “Sync over mobile data” under the Your Phone Companion app settings
When enabled, you should see the ‘Connected to your PC’ toast on your phone. 

![Your Phone](images/18908-5.jpg "sync over mobile data")

### Colorful new icons
We’re also introducing a new look for both Your Phone and Your Phone Companion, to make them truly feel like part of the Windows family. The Your Phone Companion icon has started to hit phones already, and the Your Phone icon will arrive on Windows PCs in the coming days.

![Your Phone](images/18908-6.png "new icons")

__4/26/2019__

### Never miss your Android phone’s notifications

We are excited to provide a preview into the newest feature for the Your Phone app – __Notifications__.
Stop reaching for your phone to check your notifications. Boost your focus and productivity by seeing your phone’s notifications on your PC. You are in control and manage which apps you want to receive notifications from. Dismiss a notification on one device and it goes away on the other.

![Your Phone](images/18885-apps-1.png "phone screen")
 
With this preview, you can:
* See incoming phone notifications in real-time
* View all of your phone notifications in one place
* Customize which notifications you want to receive
* Clear notifications individually or all at once

This feature will gradually roll out to Insiders on 19H1 builds. It may take a few days for this feature to show up inside the Your Phone app.

We look forward to your feedback as we continue to test, learn, and improve the overall experience.

### Phone screen now supports additional Android devices

As promised, we have expanded [phone screen support](https://aka.ms/wip18356) to additional phone models – __OnePlus 6, OnePlus 6T, Samsung Galaxy S10e, S10, S10+, Note 8, Note 9__. Try out phone screen and send us your feedback. We will continue to expand the list of supported devices over time.

__3/12/2019 - Version 1.0.20701.0__
 
### Take your phone’s screen to the big screen  

We are excited to provide an early preview into the newest feature for the Your Phone app – phone screen. You can now mirror your Android phone’s screen directly on your PC without having to dig for your phone.

![Your Phone](images/18335-1.png "phone screen")

The new phone screen feature gives you easy access to your phone apps on your PC. Whether scheduling a ride to the airport or checking your social updates, do it with ease from the comfort of your PC without having to take your phone out of your bag or go back and forth between devices. Go ahead, give your thumbs a break, and get things done faster with your keyboard and mouse.

![Your Phone](images/18335-2.png "phone screen2")

This feature will gradually roll out to Insiders on 19H1 builds. It may take a few days for this feature to show up inside the Your Phone app (version 1.0.20701.0 and above).
You can use the Your Phone app on any Windows 10 PC running Windows builds 1803 (RS4) or newer and any Android phone running Android version 7.0 or newer. But the new phone screen feature is initially only compatible with a limited set of devices. Surface Go will be the first device in the Surface lineup to preview this feature. We will continue to expand the list of devices over time for both the PC and phone.

We look forward to your feedback as we continue to test, learn, and improve the overall experience.

__Phone screen requirements:__
* Select Android phones* running Android 7.0 or greater (*Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+/S9/S9+).
* Windows 10 PC with a Bluetooth radio that supports low energy peripheral role. [How to check if your PC supports this](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2066643).
* Latest 19H1 preview build (18342+ recommended).
* Android phone must be on, within Bluetooth range of the PC, and connected to the same network as the PC.

## Snip & Sketch 

__3/6/2019 - Version 10.1901.10521.0__

We’re in the process of rolling out a new app update to Snip & Sketch. It includes a number of fixes based on your feedback, among which are:
* We fixed an issue that could result in snips being a bit blurry after saving or copying to clipboard.
* We fixed an issue where copying to clipboard would fail if you switched out of the app while the copy operation was in progress.
* We fixed an issue where the suggested file name was unexpectedly a GUID for snips opened from Win + Shift + S toast.
* We’ve added Narrator (screen reader) confirmations when a snip is copied to clipboard.
* We’ve updated the default save format to be png. You can still use the dropdown when saving to pick your desired format if it’s not png.
* We fixed an issue where auto-copy changes to clipboard wasn’t working on return from Snip & Sketch settings.
* We fixed an issue where the app might crash if you closed two app windows one after another.
* We fixed an issue where the default save file location was documents rather than pictures. In fixing this we also fixed an issue where when saving the save dialog wouldn’t remember where you last saved a snip.

The rollout of this app is not tied to the upgrade, so you may see it outside the bounds of this flight.

__12/10/2018 - Version 10.1811.3371.0__

### Bring window snip to your modern snipping experience.
 Start your snip via your preferred entry point (WIN + Shift + S, Print Screen (if you’ve enabled it), directly from within Snip & Sketch, etc.), and select the window snip option at the top, and snip away! That selection will be remembered the next time you start a snip.

![Windows Snip](images/snip_window.png "windows snip")


__10/31/2018 - Version 10.1809.2964.0__

This update brings several improvements, including:
- **Adding some emphasis.** Planning to paste your screenshot somewhere? Does that place have the same color background as the background of your screenshot? When you update to the latest app version you’ll find a new option to add a border to your screenshots – giving them that little bit extra needed to stand out.
- **Printing!** Sometimes you want to keep a physical copy of your screenshots – we hear you that it took too many steps before, and have added a button in the toolbar so you can print directly from the app. (You can also print to PDF!)  
![Printing](images/18272-app1.jpg "The Print option in Snip & Sketch")

- **Refining our save options:**
   - If you have unsaved changes and go to close a window or open a file that will now pop a confirmation.
   - The default proposed file name will now include a timestamp.
   - Saving now also supports .jpg and .gif file types.
   - New settings page! We’re replacing the old **About** flyout with a full settings page where you’ll find the aforementioned option to add a border, an option for updates made to your snip to copy automatically to your clipboard, and more.
   ![New Settings page](images/18272-app2.png "The Settings page in Snip & Sketch")


__9/6/2018 - Version 10.1807.2286.0__

### Delay Snip 
We flighted version 10.1807.2286.0 of **Snip & Sketch** (née Screen Sketch), which included the highly requested delay snip feature. There was a bug in Build 18219 blocking the New button from working, so please try it out once you upgrade! 

Just click the chevron next to the New button in the app and you’ll now find options to **Snip now**, **Snip in 3 seconds**, and **Snip in 10 seconds**. If you have the app open or pinned to your taskbar, you can also just right click the icon in the taskbar to get these options, since we’ve added them to the jump list – let us know what you’d like to see next!

## Mail & Calendar 

__2/1/2019 - Version 16.0.11231.20082__

Currently rolling out to Insiders in Fast, this app update brings:

### Dark mode now extended to Mail and Calendar items
Building on our previous release of Dark mode in Mail and Calendar, we have extended our dark UI to more parts of our app. With this update, Dark mode now works when composing a new message, updating a calendar item or reading your email. This helps provide a calmer reading experience for people that work in a low light environment or just prefer screens that are less bright, and helps to reduce eye strain.

To turn on Dark mode, go to settings, select “Personalization”, and choose “Dark mode”. For those who already have Dark mode enabled, you will see it expand to cover your email reading and compose experiences after receiving the update.

If you prefer to view a particular email in light mode, look for the sunshine icon in the command bar to “turn on the lights” and view the email with a white background. This can help if a particular email is not formatted well for Dark mode.

![Dark mode](images/18329-5.jpg "Dark mode now extended to Mail and Calendar items")

### Default Font
We are introducing a top customer requested feature: Default font. Now you can customize how new messages will look. If you create a new mail or reply to an existing mail, the text you type will be in the font face, size, color and emphasis you have selected.  To change your default font, go into settings and select “Default font”. Default font applies per-account and does not roam to other devices. These updates are the latest in a [series of updates](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s-new-in-mail-and-calendar-for-windows-10-9822b33c-b9ad-48bc-ac53-c1b6136e405b?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) we’ve made based on your feedback, and we’re looking forward to hearing what you’d like to see improved next!

![Dark mode](images/18329-6.png "Dark mode now extended to Mail and Calendar items")

## Microsoft To-Do 

__12/18/2018__ 

### Get more done with Cortana and Microsoft To-Do

Want just one to-do list that works twice as hard for you? Save time and stay organized – Cortana helps by adding your reminders and tasks to your lists in [Microsoft To-Do](https://aka.ms/getMicrosoftToDo) with this feature preview, so you can stay on top of what matters most. Use your voice, your PC, your phone – your choice.

Streamline your tasks – your lists and reminders from across Microsoft To-Do, Cortana, and tasks in Outlook can now become one, centrally located in your Microsoft To-Do app. Use Microsoft To-Do anywhere: on your Android or iPhone, with Cortana, or on your Windows 10 PC. You can also access it from the web. It’s automatically synced so you never miss a beat.
When you ask Cortana to add milk to your grocery list, it’ll show up on one of your Microsoft To-Do lists.

![Microsoft To-Do](images/18267-1.gif "To-Do and Cortana integration")

Or, ask Cortana to remind you to call a friend and see the reminder appear in your Microsoft To-Do planned list.

![Microsoft To-Do](images/18267-2.gif "To-Do and Cortana reminders")

With this integration, we are furthering efforts to seamlessly sync your to-do lists across Microsoft To-Do, Cortana, and your tasks in Outlook. 

To start syncing, your Windows 10 PC must be running Build 18267+ and tied to either the Australia, India, US, or UK region. [Learn more about the Microsoft To-Do and Cortana integration](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/articles/microsoft-to-do-and-cortana-integration/). To share feedback, join the cohort or use the Windows Feedback Hub. use the Windows Feedback Hub.

__9/6/2018 - Version 1.39.1808.31001__

### Handwriting support 
We added support for handwritten input to allow you to capture your tasks seamlessly in Microsoft To-Do (Version 1.39.1808.31001 and higher).
Please try it out and let us know what you think by tweeting at [@MicrosoftToDo](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftToDo) on Twitter. With Ink you now can:
1. Capture your tasks naturally by writing directly on the list’s surface.
2. Complete your tasks by striking through them.
3. Use check-marks within the circle to the left of a task to complete it.

## Feedback Hub 

__8/21/2019 - Version 1907__

The Feedback Hub team has been hard at work lately to bring you some app updates based on your feature requests, and we have a few changes and improvements to share about the latest version that’s currently rolling out to Insiders in the Fast ring.

### Feedback Search UI updates
On the Feedback section of the app, you will now be able to more clearly see the differentiation between Problems and Suggestions, with each showing an icon, color, and labels Problem or Suggestion displayed above each feedback entry. We also have updated iconography and displays for Adding similar feedback to problems, upvoting suggestions, and adding comments to feedback.

![Feedback Hub](images/18965-2.png "Feedback Search UI updates")

### Adding similar feedback

In the past, Feedback Hub allowed two kinds of participation on feedback: upvoting and adding more details. The notion of voting on Suggestions makes a lot of sense – engineers at Microsoft want to know which features the community wants us to build next, and voting on feature suggestions is a great way to see where your interest lies.

However, voting on Problems was trickier – problems are not a matter of popularity, and what helps engineers here resolve problems is having clear descriptions of how the issue arose. Feedback is especially helpful if it includes a reproduction of the problem, diagnostics that help our teams pinpoint what went wrong so they can fix issues faster. Voting on the search page often did not provide enough detail as to what was happening, and we saw that few people went into existing feedback to add their personal reproductions of the issues.

With the new Add similar feedback feature, selecting a problem with symptoms that match your own will take you to the feedback form, with the title pre-filled. You edit the title or add your own description to let us know exactly what was happening when you encountered the problem. We’ll already have your category selected to ensure the right feature team sees your feedback, and in our new Similar Feedback section, the feedback you selected will already be selected. As usual, the last step involves optionally adding your own reproduction of the issue or any attachments you like.

### Windows Insiders Achievements

We are excited to announce a refresh of the Windows Insider Achievements page. We’ve made achievements more discoverable by moving them from your profile page to their own landing page, and we added additional features that allow you to categorize and track your progress. Be sure to check it out today and begin unlocking badges. We would love to hear your feedback on social media by using the hashtag #Builds4Badges.

The information previously found in your profile (Device ID and User ID) is now located in the settings section of Feedback Hub.

As always, we appreciate your feedback – if you have any suggestions or problems to report, you can share them in the Feedback Hub under Apps > Feedback Hub.

![Feedback Hub](images/18965-3.png "Windows Insiders Achievements")

__12/10/2018 - Version 1811__

This update includes:
- We’ve updated the navigation pane to now use the common control – that means when switching between sections you’ll now see that nice little transition animation!
- We’ve made some improvements to how the UI flows between different window sizes.
- Screenshots and Steps capture images can be now be easily reviewed in the app.
- When creating a new feedback item, that feedback is auto-saved as a draft.  If the app closes unexpectedly in the middle of writing feedback, when you re-open the Feedback Hub you’ll now get notified of the existing draft so you can easily resume.
- You can now check for app updates from the settings page in the Feedback Hub. We’ll also automatically check for app updates on app launch, and you’ll get a notification letting you know one is available.

## Game Bar 

__12/10/2018__
