# The Changelog

The Changelog represents everything new from all the builds from the Active Development Branch (RS_PRERELEASE) released to the Fast ring. 

## Build 19569
Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 19569 was released to the Fast ring on [2/20/2020](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/02/20/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-19569/).

### Evolving the Windows 10 icons
We are currently working [on a multi-year effort across Microsoft’s design teams](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/the-ripple-effect-expanding-our-icon-design-system-74b4d916b7a4) to redesign the icons across all our products. We started with the Office icons, and now we’re moving forward with updating the icons in Windows 10, starting with the built-in apps like Alarms & Clock, Calculator, Mail, and Calendar. Research and feedback from Windows Insiders showed a desire to see consistency in design and connection to the brand, with enough differences to aid in recognition. You can read all about our approach to updating the icons in Windows 10 in [this Medium post from the Microsoft Design Team](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/iconic-icons-designing-the-world-of-windows-5e70e25e5416)!

Many of these icons will be updated as app updates from the Microsoft Store. We are beginning to roll them out to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring first, starting today. The Mail and Calendar icons rolled out this morning to Release Preview. Over the coming months, Insiders will see more of the icons in Windows 10 get updated with new designs!

### General changes, improvements, and fixes
* We fixed an issue resulting in OneDrive not working and using an unexpectedly high amount of CPU for some Insiders on the previous build.
* We resolved an issue where SCSI drivers weren’t being recognized with certain third-party virtual machines, which was causing c1900191 errors on these devices. We’re continuing to investigate additional c1900191 errors on other devices.
* We fixed an issue impacting Start menu reliability after upgrade for some Insiders.
* We fixed an issue resulting in some Insiders experiencing a green screen with a SYSTEMTHREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED error on recent builds.
