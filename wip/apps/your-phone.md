### Announcing Your Phone multi-apps experience—Interact with multiple Android mobile apps at the same time on your Windows 10 PC

The [Your Phone apps experience](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/08/05/microsoft-and-samsung-expand-partnership-empowering-you-across-work-and-play/) is continuing to evolve. We're happy to announce that the multi-apps experience is now ready for you to try. You can experience the power and convenience of running multiple Android mobile apps side by side on your Windows 10 PC on supported Samsung devices. Apps will launch in separate windows, letting you interact with multiple apps at the same time, even if the Your Phone app is not open. Pin your apps to Favorites, Windows 10 taskbar, or Start menu for quick and easy access. And now you can search for your previously pinned apps using Windows search from within your Start app list. So, whether you are staying connected with family and friends, keeping up on your social feed, or ordering food, you can do it all simultaneously from the comfort of your PC, no need to install apps or sign in again.

![Screen showing phone apps opened side by side as separate apps on a Windows10 PC.](images/Your-Phone-multi-apps.png)

Starting last Thursday, the multi-apps feature has started to roll out on supported Samsung Galaxy phones (Note20 5G, Note20 Ultra 5G, Z Fold2 5G, Z Flip, Z Flip 5G) running Android 10 with Link to Windows (LTW) integration and to Windows Insiders who are configured to be in the Dev Channel, Beta Channel, or Release Preview Channel. Please note that this is a server-side change that takes time to reach everyone.

### New Your Phone settings experience for seamless device management within the app

The Your Phone team is excited to roll out a new user experience for managing your linked devices with the app. We are happy to announce with this new settings page, you can now link a new device, remove an old device, and switch between active devices, all easily within the app. We’ve also made visual improvements to displaying your device list. Now each device is identifiable on its own device card with your personally synced wallpaper.

![The Your Phone app displaying the new my devices section of settings.](images/YPSettings-09302020.jpg)

This new user experience will be gradually rolling out to Insiders, so it may take some time to show up in the Your Phone app.

## September 23, 2020

### Your Phone Notifications gets a new pinning feature
We're excited to announce that the Your Phone app has a new pinning feature integrated with the notifications feed. With notifications pinning, you can easily pin to save important notifications that will stick to the top of your feed, so they are readily accessible and distinguished from the rest of your notifications. To try out this feature, find a notification you want to pin and select the ellipses in the overflow menu. There you will see the option **Pin notification**.

Since the notification will now stick to the top of your feed, you no longer have to worry about losing the notification and can easily access the thread and use all your favorite functionality, like in-line reply. When you no longer need that notification thread, you can simply unpin it by choosing the unpin icon.

![Your Phone app on Notifications feature with Notifications menu pinning expanded.](images/YPNotifications-092320.jpg)

This is a gradual rollout, so it may take a few days for notifications pinning to show up within the Your Phone app.

Starting today, Android phones supporting Your Phone app’s Phone screen feature will be able to preview the Apps feature. See list of supported devices here.

Black screen will show during a phone screen session on all supported devices (any device that supports Link to Windows). The black screen kicks in when the session is initiated and dismisses itself when it ends. The user can dismiss the black screen anytime by:

### Photos has evolved. View and interact with your most recent 2000 photos!
We take a lot of photos on our smartphones. We heard our avid Your Phone app users when you when you said you wanted the ability to access more than 25 of your recent photos. Today, we’re happy to announce that we’ve addressed this by letting you view and interact with your most recent 2,000 photos from your Android smartphone’s camera roll on your PC!

With the Your Phone Photos feature, you don’t have to email photos to yourself. Simply take a pic and see it instantly on your PC. When you need to add a recent image to your email, paper, or presentation, just drag and drop. You can also conveniently share it with family or friends or save it directly to your PC by simply right clicking on the image.

Try out this newly enhanced capability and share your experience.

![Your Phone app recent photos page](images/19536-4.png)

**Photos requirements**

* Any Android phones running version 7.0 or higher
* PC running Windows 10 April 2018 Update (1803) or higher

**Known issues**
* If the Photo selector in Messages appears blank, navigate to Photos on the left and hit refresh. Your photos should now appear in the Photo selector.

This feature will gradually roll out to Windows Insiders on the Windows 10 May 2019 Update or newer, so it may take a few days to be available inside the Your Phone app. Please make sure you have the latest versions of Your Phone Companion and the Your Phone app to experience this feature.

### Phone screen now supports pen input
The Phone screen feature is getting a boost. In addition to keyboard, mouse, and touch support, you can now use your digital pen with a compatible stylus to input on any touch screen enabled Windows 10 PC to interact with your mobile apps while in Phone screen session. Leverage your pen’s pressure sensitivity for drawing and writing like you would with your phone’s stylus with apps that support pressure sensitivity. You will also be able to hover over buttons, and it differentiates between the pen and finger touch.

## October 29, 2019

### Elevating the Phone screen feature by removing its dependency on Bluetooth connection

Windows Insiders, we heard your feedback about the Phone screen feature’s dependency on Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. To address your feedback, we partnered closely with Samsung to bring you a more streamlined experience across all Windows 10 PCs by removing the peripheral role dependency for Phone screen, which will expand the overall reach of this feature.

Samsung Galaxy Note 10 was the first device to introduce this feature in August. After a positive response, we’ve recently enabled this feature across Samsung Galaxy Fold, S10, S10+, and S10e smartphones. You’ll need to update your supported Samsung devices with the recent software update that enables the ‘Link to Windows’ feature. To continue offering this experience to other smartphones, we’re expanding this feature support to Samsung Galaxy A30s, A50s, and A90 smartphones, and we’ll continue to add additional devices in the coming months.

With the new experience rolling out, we’ll be removing the Bluetooth connectivity option, effective immediately. If you were previously enjoying Phone screen over Bluetooth and you have a phone model that doesn’t yet support Link to Windows, the Phone screen node will disappear automatically within the Your Phone app. We recommend that you unpair your devices by going to the Bluetooth settings on both your PC and your Android phone, so that you don’t have a connection that is no longer in use.

Thank you for helping us refine the Phone screen experience so far!

**Phone screen requirements**

* Select Android phones running Android 9.0 or greater
* PC running Windows 10 October 2018 Update (version 1809) or later
* Android phone must be on and connected to the same network as the PC
* You will need a supported device to use this feature: 
    * Samsung Galaxy Fold
    * Samsung Galaxy Note 10/ Note 10+
    * Samsung Galaxy S10/S10+/S10e
    * Samsung Galaxy A30s/A50s/A90

### Phone screen accessibility features, keyboard language and layout, new phone models
We’re pleased to preview two new accessibility features – screen reading and focus tracking – as well as the ability to easily switch your Android phone’s keyboard language or layout while in phone screen.

**Screen reading**

For users of TalkBack, you can now enable the Your Phone Companion accessibility service, found under your Android phone’s accessibility settings, for smoother cross-device reading. Once both TalkBack and the Your Phone Companion accessibility services are turned on, Narrator will play from your PC, describing what you select and activate on your phone screen as you interact using your PC’s keyboard or mouse.

![Your Phone companion accessibility service](images/18908-1.png)

**Focus tracking**

You will now be able to interact with your Android phone’s apps at your preferred magnification while in phone screen. Focus tracking will seamlessly follow your keyboard focus and mouse pointer input.

To enable the focus tracking accessibility feature, you must first turn on the Your Phone Companion accessibility service and TalkBack on your Android phone. Once these services are enabled, you can turn on Magnifier on your PC using the shortcut **Win** + **(+)** or open the app from your Windows menu.

**Keyboard language and layout** 

You will notice a new icon on your phone screen toolbar. Selecting this icon will take you to the phone settings page, where you can change your keyboard language or layout. This setting is specific to physical keyboards, so it only applies when you’re typing into your phone from your PC and will not change your phone’s language or keyboard configuration. If you type in different languages or like to switch your keyboard layout, give it a try.

### Never miss your Android phone’s notifications

We are excited to provide a preview into the newest feature for the Your Phone app – __Notifications__.
Stop reaching for your phone to check your notifications. Boost your focus and productivity by seeing your phone’s notifications on your PC. You are in control and manage which apps you want to receive notifications from. Dismiss a notification on one device and it goes away on the other.

With this preview, you can:

* See incoming phone notifications in real-time

* Clear notifications individually or all at once

This feature will gradually roll out to Insiders on 19H1 builds. It may take a few days for this feature to show up inside the Your Phone app.

We look forward to your feedback as we continue to test, learn, and improve the overall experience.
