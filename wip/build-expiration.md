# Updating from an expiring Insider Preview build
Windows 10/11 Insider Preview Builds do expire eventually. Staying up to date is key to avoiding security risks, which is why expiration dates are important.

If your device is on an expiring build, you'll start getting notifications letting you know that you need to update. Go to [**Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Update**](https://aka.ms/WIPWindowsUpdate) and select **Check for Updates** to get the latest update available in your channel.

If you aren't seeing any updates available, you might be experiencing issues preventing updates. Or, if you'd already installed a build in the Dev Channel and tried to [switch channels](./flighting.md#switching-between-channels) or [stop receiving Insider Preview builds](./troubleshooting.md) without doing a clean installation of Windows, you might not be seeing updates either.

To move off the Insider Preview build expiring on your device, you can either get preview builds in the Dev Channel, reinstall Windows using a Windows Insider ISO to move to the Beta channel, or start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10/11.

## Get Insider Preview Builds in the Dev Channel

1. Go to [**Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Insider Program**](https://aka.ms/WIPSettings) on your device.

2. Set it to the Dev Channel.

3. Go to [**Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Update**](https://aka.ms/WIPWindowsUpdate) to check for the latest update, and update your device to the latest build available in the Dev Channel.

## Reinstall Windows with a Windows Insider Beta Channel ISO

1. Back up all your files and applications. A clean install with a Windows Insider ISO will erase all of your files, settings, and applications.

2. [Download the latest Beta Channel ISO from the Windows Insider ISO page](https://aka.ms/WIPISO) by saving it to a location on your PC or [creating a bootable USB](https://aka.ms/WIPbootISO).

3. Open File Explorer and go to where you saved the ISO. Select the ISO file to open it, which lets Windows mount the image so you can access it.

4. Select the Setup.exe file to launch the install process. 

5. During setup, select the **Change what to keep** option, and then choose **Nothing** on the next screen to complete a clean intall.

6. Once it's finished installing, go to [**Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Insider Program**](https://aka.ms/WIPSettings) to set up Insider Preview builds in the Beta Channel. [Get more help setting up Insider Preview builds.](https://insider.windows.com/getting-started#flight)

## Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 11

2. [Download the latest Windows 11 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11) by saving it to a location on your PC or [creating a bootable USB](https://aka.ms/WIPbootISO).

3. Open File Explorer and go to where you saved the ISO. Select the ISO file to open it, which lets Windows mount the image so you can access it.

4. Select the Setup.exe file to launch the install process. 

5. During setup, select the **Change what to keep** option, and then choose **Nothing** on the next screen to complete a clean install.

6. Once it's finished installing, go to [**Settings** > **Windows Update** > **Windows Insider Program**](https://aka.ms/WIPSettings) if you'd like to set up Insider Preview builds again. [Get more help setting up Insider Preview builds.](./get-started.md#start-flighting)
